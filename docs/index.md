# Phouebus Engine
<br>
Welcome to Phoebus Engine! <br>
This engine is made by two 3rd grade students of Design and Development of Videogames on CITM university (Terrassa, Barcelona, Spain) under the supervision and guidance of lecturer [Marc Garrigó](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mgarrigo/?originalSubdomain=es). <br><br>
The intent is to create a functional 3D engine with a focus on performance and Audio capabilities (hence the engine name). Because of that, we'll provide a deeper analysis of the audio system further down the web. <br><br>
If you wish to contact us or provide any kind of feedback, we'll gladly answer all your questions.<br>
    
We hope you'll enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed making it!
